# Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis

# Objective
The objective of this task was to analyze a sample phishing email to identify its malicious characteristics[cite: 4]. This exercise helps in developing skills for email threat detection and understanding the tactics used by attackers.

# Process
1.  First, an example of a common phishing email (a fake PayPal alert) was obtained from an online source.
2.  The email's content was carefully examined for common red flags.
3.  Key indicators such as the sender's address, urgent language, spelling errors, and suspicious links were identified.
4.  A final report was compiled to summarize all the phishing traits found in the email sample.
